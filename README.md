Pitch constellations are a way of showing musical pitches with respect to an octave. This project demos various chords and scales and allows you to play them.

Constellations can span 3 octaves as opposed to a single octave. The magnitude of the rays representing pitch is indicative of its octave.

Built as a learning project for Cordova and Polymer.
